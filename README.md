# A python program to play (and solve) a sudoku puzzle
## How it works:
- Enter a number at the empty squares to pencil them
- you can pencil as many squares at the same time as you want
- once you press 'c' the penciled choices are validated. If even one of them is invalid (could still be incorrect) all the penciled numbers will be discarded
- once 's' is pressed the answer is shown
- This solution is built using a backtracking algorithm to avoid the exponential complexity of a brute-force exhaustive search algorithm
